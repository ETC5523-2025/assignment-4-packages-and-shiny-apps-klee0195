Welcome!

I am Kim, a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University.

With a background in finance and econometrics from my undergraduate studies, I bring an adventurous, challenge-seeking spirit and a strong desire to continue my academic journey at Monash. Through this program, I aim to strengthen my ability to explore data and uncover the stories it tells. These are skills that aligns and resonates with the analytical foundation from my bachelor studies.

I created **Housepack** to make it easier for students and analysts to explore how income, housing, and capital gains in Australia have evolved over time. This project combines what I’ve learned in data storytelling, R programming, and interactive dashboards using `Shiny` and `pkgdown`.
